This is a command line based 3 on 3 simulator. This is a working Beta 
version and updates are being made slowly, in my free time. Currently 
main simply creates 2 teams, prompts the user to draft them, and then 
runs 10 simulation games and prints out the stats. Updates are coming eventually.

My next step is to implement more skater features, such as skater types, and team
features, such as team chemistry based on real life team and skater type. 
After that I will implement goalies.

Beyond this I want to implement a season mode with consistent teams that can be 
saved and loaded, trade players, keep season statistics, etc. 

This was created in Visual Studio, so there is no makefile to compile and
run on linux, but that may be coming soon as well.
