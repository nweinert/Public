This is the final project for CS162, Intro to Computer Science 2.
There is a lot of duplicate code in this project, and things that could
and should have been done better. I have left it as it was when I first
created the project in order to show whatever growth has occurred in my 
abilities. This project was in the early stages of me learning how to 
be a developer. I feel that I have and will continue to improve above
and beyond the quality of this work.
